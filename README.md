# Excel Macros

**Macro Collection**

_Version: R1.00_

## 🎯 Repository Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive collection of Macros designed for automating a range of tasks for my own personal usage. 

These scripts aim to enhance productivity 🚀, reduce manual effort 🛠️, and streamline processes across various domains such as file management, data processing, system administration, and random items. These all served their purpose and have avoided a lot of personal hours.

I am not a coder and these are by no means usable within a business environment. Use at your own risk.

## 🌟 This repository is intended for:

Anyone who's dabbling along 🤓.
